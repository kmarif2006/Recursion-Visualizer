# Recursion Visualizer

Welcome to **Recursion Visualizer**! This project helps you understand and visualize how recursive functions work by graphically representing each recursion call as a node in a tree-like structure. The visualization provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of recursive calls, making it easier to grasp the flow of recursive algorithms.

## Features
- **Supports Multiple Algorithms**: Visualize popular recursion algorithms like Fibonacci, Factorial, Power, GCD, Binary Search, Array Sum, and Tower of Hanoi.
- **Beautiful UI**: A clean, responsive design built using **Tailwind CSS**.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive styling.
- **Visualization**: Plain JavaScript for recursion logic and rendering the tree structure.
- **Other**: JavaScript for recursive logic implementation.

## Algorithms Supported
This visualizer currently supports the following basic recursion algorithms:
- **Fibonacci Series**: Visualize the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers, represented as a tree structure where each node corresponds to a function call.
- **Factorial**: Visualize the factorial calculation using recursion, with nodes branching for each recursive call.
- **Power**: See how exponentiation works with recursion, showing the tree structure of function calls.
- **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)**: Visualize the process of finding the GCD using recursion, with each step forming a node.
- **Binary Search**: Watch how the binary search algorithm works recursively, visualized as a tree of decisions.
- **Array Sum**: Visualize the sum of an array using recursion, each recursive step displayed as a branching node.
- **Tower of Hanoi**: See how the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is solved recursively, represented as a tree of moves.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for running the project)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (for managing dependencies)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recursion-visualizer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd recursion-visualizer
   ```

3. **Install and build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run install-build
   ```
   This command will install all necessary dependencies and create an optimized production build.

4. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will launch the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Development
- The development server will automatically reload if you make changes to the source files
- Any lint errors will be shown in the console

## Build for Production
To create a production build, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create an optimized build in the `build` folder.
