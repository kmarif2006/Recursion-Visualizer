# Recursion Visualizer

Welcome to **Recursion Visualizer**! This project helps you understand and visualize how recursive functions work by graphically representing each recursion call as a node in a tree-like structure. The visualization provides a clear, step-by-step breakdown of recursive calls, making it easier to grasp the flow of recursive algorithms.

## Features

- **Supports Multiple Algorithms**: Visualize popular recursion algorithms like Fibonacci, Factorial, Power, GCD, Binary Search, Array Sum, and Tower of Hanoi.
- **Beautiful UI**: A clean, responsive design built using **Tailwind CSS**.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js for building the user interface.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive styling.
- **Visualization**: Plain JavaScript for recursion logic and rendering the tree structure.
- **Other**: JavaScript for recursive logic implementation.

## Algorithms Supported

This visualizer currently supports the following basic recursion algorithms:

- **Fibonacci Series**: Visualize the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers, represented as a tree structure where each node corresponds to a function call.
- **Factorial**: Visualize the factorial calculation using recursion, with nodes branching for each recursive call.
- **Power**: See how exponentiation works with recursion, showing the tree structure of function calls.
- **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)**: Visualize the process of finding the GCD using recursion, with each step forming a node.
- **Binary Search**: Watch how the binary search algorithm works recursively, visualized as a tree of decisions.
- **Array Sum**: Visualize the sum of an array using recursion, each recursive step displayed as a branching node.
- **Tower of Hanoi**: See how the Tower of Hanoi puzzle is solved recursively, represented as a tree of moves.
